# Lab2FileInput
This program I created for my CS232 Computer Programming Class in Java. In this program, I was given a file named "lab2_input.txt" and I had to read the file and skip the top line of the file because the number there only tells how many numbers are in the file. Once I read the file into my program, I then had to take the numbers inside the file and sort them into ranges. After I sorted the file by range, I had to print the range quantities out like this example below. 

For example, given the sample file input ...

26
76 89 150 135 200 76 12 100 150 28 178 189 167 200 175 150 87 99 129 149 176 200 87 35 157 189

... the output should resemble the following ...


[0 - 24]: 1
[25 - 49]: 2
[50 - 74]: 0
[75 - 99]: 6
[100 - 124]: 1
[125 - 149]: 3
[150 - 174]: 5
[175 - 200]: 8
